Based on the content in `.aiwork\prd.md`, create two comprehensive documentation files:

1. **Solution Overview Document** (`.aiwork\solution.md`):
   - Create a high-level solution overview that directly addresses the requirements outlined in the PRD
   - Include the key components and features of the proposed solution
   - Explain how the solution meets the business objectives and user needs from the PRD
   - Provide a summary of the technical approach and implementation strategy

2. **Architecture Document** (`.aiwork\architecture.md`):
   - Provide a detailed architectural overview of the proposed solution
   - Include relevant technical diagrams such as:
     - Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD) for data models
     - System flow diagrams showing user interactions and data flow
     - Component architecture diagrams showing system modules and their relationships
     - Any other diagrams that clarify the technical implementation
   - Document key architectural decisions and rationale
   - Include technology stack recommendations
   - Provide sufficient technical detail to enable creation of a comprehensive implementation plan
   - Consider scalability, security, and maintainability aspects

Both documents should be written in clear, professional markdown format and should complement each other - the solution.md focusing on the "what" and "why", while the architecture.md focuses on the "how" from a technical perspective.
