Create a detailed implementation plan in Markdown format and save it to a file in the `@.aiwork/` directory. The plan should outline all the steps neede.

For each task in the plan:
1. Assign a sequential number (1, 2, 3, etc.)
2. Include a status checkbox at the beginning of each task:
   - Use `[ ]` for tasks not yet implemented
   - Use `[X]` for completed tasks
3. Write a clear prompt that I can use to instruct you to implement that specific task
4. Include verification criteria that describe how to confirm the task has been successfully completed

Make sure each task is atomic (focused on a single, specific action) and the entire plan covers all necessary steps.

Name the file `implementationplan.md`.

After you have created the plan, then review it to make sure it fully covers the original issue, and the plan is consistent.
